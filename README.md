# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Project
In this project, classification algorithms, i.e Logistic regression, KNeighbors Classifier, SVC are used for the loan eligibility prediction.


It's a classification problem. In this project, I applied all the classification algorithms to identify the customers segments; those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.
